Plant Disease Recognition System üåøüîç
Overview
The Plant Disease Recognition System is designed to help farmers, agriculturists, and researchers identify plant diseases efficiently and accurately. By analyzing images of plants, the system detects signs of diseases and provides actionable recommendations, enabling healthier crops and improved harvests.

Features
Upload & Analyze: Upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases and let the system do the rest.
Advanced Algorithms: Uses state-of-the-art machine learning for high accuracy in disease detection.
User-Friendly Interface: Simplified and intuitive design for seamless interaction.
Quick Results: Get disease analysis and recommendations within seconds.
Dataset Information
The model is trained on a dataset containing 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves across 38 different classes.

Dataset Breakdown:
Training Set: 70,295 images
Validation Set: 17,572 images
Test Set: 33 images
The dataset is derived from offline augmentation of an original dataset available on GitHub. Images are structured and divided into an 80:20 ratio for training and validation.

How It Works
Upload Image: Navigate to the Disease Recognition page and upload your plant image.
Analysis: The system processes the image using cutting-edge ML algorithms to identify potential diseases.
Results: View disease identification results and receive recommendations for treatment or prevention.
